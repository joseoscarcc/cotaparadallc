You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</span></p>

                        <h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">How Do We Protect Your Information?</span></h2>
                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Cota Parada LLC or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</span></p>

                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cota Parada LLC is incorporated in United States. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">Is the information collected through the Cota Parada LLC Service secure?</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</span></p>

Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections.

Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>

                        <h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">What is GDPR?</span></h2>
                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents&#39; data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</span></p>
                        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers&rsquo; data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">What is personal data?</span></h2>
                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person&rsquo;s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</span></p>
                        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</span></p>
                        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <ul class="c8 lst-kix_list_5-0 start">
                            <li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</span></li>
                            <li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</span></li>
                            <li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</span></li>
                            <li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</span></li>

                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals&#39; personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it&#39;s simply the right thing to do. At Cota Parada LLC we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</span></p>

                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Cota Parada LLC processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</span></p>
                        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data.
